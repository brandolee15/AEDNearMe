          Step 1: If you suspect someone is having a cardiac arrest, check the person over, tilt the head back and check for breathing for 10 seconds. If the person is unresponsive, ask someone to call 999/112 and tell them to bring an AED

          Step 2: Start hands only CPR, lock your hands together and place them by the person's chest.

          Step 3: With straight arms, use your body to push 5-6cm in depth at a rate of 100-120 bpm. (For reference, use the beat of Staying Alive by the Bee Gees)

          Step 4: Keep doing hands only CPR until a defibrillator is present and the ambulance arrives. If there are multiple people around you, switch to other helpers every 5 rounds of 30 pushes to avoid fatigue.
